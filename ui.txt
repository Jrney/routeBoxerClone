interviewing Users by Steve Portugal
 Evil By Design by Chris Nodder

 ask questions why did you do this ,
 why did you go that, have no strong reactions
 to what people say in an interview

 -the time that it took you to do that,
 was that too much?

 -long web processes - notify users up front
 about how long stuff should take
"this will take 15 min and you will need these
docs with you"

 -most users should be able to find a simple task in under 5 seconds

 -new employees - go to user research and volunteer to test some stuff.
